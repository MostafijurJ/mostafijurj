As a Java developer with over 4 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and a passion for building scalable and efficient solutions.

In my current role as a Java developer at <a href="https://brainstation-23.com/">Brain Station 23 Limited</a>, I have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of *Internet Banking* systems and *microservices* based platforms. I have extensive experience with tools and technologies such as *Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Apache Kafka for real-time data processing, as well as CI/CD tools like Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins*. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge as a developer.

I pursued my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://just.edu.bd/">Jashore University of Science and Technology</a> in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in 2019.
