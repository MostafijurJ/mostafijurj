As a Java developer with over 2.5 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and a passion for solving complex technical challenges.

In my current role as a Java developer at <a href ="https://brainstation-23.com/"> Brain Station 23 Limited </a>, I have worked on a variety of projects, including the development of Internet Banking systems and wallets. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge as a developer.

I pursued my bachelor's degree from <a href ="https://just.edu.bd/"> Jashore University of Science and Technology </a>  in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) in 2020.
